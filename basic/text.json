      "prompt": "Classic car enthusiasts are a passionate and knowledgeable marketing audience driven by a deep appreciation for automotive history, craftsmanship, and the unique driving experience that older vehicles offer. They are often, though not exclusively, older males with mid-to-high incomes, viewing classic cars not just as transportation but as investments, collectibles, and extensions of their personal identity. These individuals are often community-oriented, participating in car clubs and shows, and may be hands-on with maintenance and restoration, valuing originality and authenticity. Marketing to this group requires detailed, accurate information, high-quality visuals, and messaging that taps into their nostalgia, desire for uniqueness, and the emotional connection they have with these vehicles, often found within specialized online communities, publications, and events."
